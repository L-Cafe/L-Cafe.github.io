If you have a job offer, please use the social links on this page to
contact me on your preferred communication method and request my resume.

My name is León Castillejos. I'm a Higher Technician in Multi-Platform Applications Development.
Currently studying Computer Science & Engineering at
[URJC](http://www.urjc.es/), a Spanish university located in Madrid.

I consider myself a passionate and creative individual who thrives in highly
competitive and intellectually demanding environments.

My native country is Spain, so my primary language is Spanish. I can also speak
and write (British) English fluently, and I'm currently learning Norwegian (Bokmål Norsk).

I love travelling. I have visited the following countries:

I want to visit these countries:

I created this blog in order to have a centralised place to express my opinion
and share what I know with the world.

## How I do my computing

I own a MacBook Pro 2016, and use macOS on a daily
basis. I also use Linux very often, and maintain some Linux servers running
Debian, Proxmox, CentOS, Fedora Server, and a Windows Server as an
experimentation platform.

For editing code, I use Visual Studio Code with a Vim extension. I wrote a
[post]({% post_url 2018-05-14-my-vscode-extensions %}) on the
extensions I use the most.

My shell of choice is zsh. My settings are published
[here](https://github.com/L1Cafe/My-Preferences/tree/master/macOS).

My favourite programming languages are: Python, Rust and Ruby (on Rails).

For writing documents, I use a combination of LaTeX and Markdown, depending on
whether what I write will be published on the web (for which I use Markdown,
with LaTeX math formulas through MathJax), or needs to be printed, or released
as a PDF file, (for which I use plain LaTeX).

For my photo editing and graphical design needs, I rely on
[Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/), and
[Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/).
