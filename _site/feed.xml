Spamming is so cheap that even a 10% opening rate is a tremendous success, because sending e-mails doesn‚Äôt require paying fees to ISPs (like you would with mass SMSs and robocalls), and it also doesn‚Äôt require hiring anyone to take the time to manually write and send e-mails (as opposed to postal spam, which have to be physically delivered into mailboxes by people), when you can just buy e-mail addresses in bulks by thousands of providers that sell active e-mail addresses by prices so ridiculously affordable, it lowers the barrier to entry dramatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why, nowadays, postmasters and system administrators need to be aware of (and correctly implement) the many technologies that exist to reduce the amount of spam received. Among them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dkim.org/&quot;&gt;DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dmarc.org/&quot;&gt;DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting &amp;amp; Conformance)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.openspf.org&quot;&gt;SPF (Sender Policy Framework)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dnsbl.info/&quot;&gt;DNSBLs (Domain Name System Blacklists)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.greylisting.org/&quot;&gt;Greylisting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://spamassassin.apache.org/&quot;&gt;SpamAssassin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most e-mail servers implement these tools to some degree, or use alternatives, of which there are plenty. Especially the first three elements are considered an integral part of e-mail technology nowadays, and most e-mail servers will reject your mail if you haven‚Äôt properly implemented these technologies in your service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, like I said, spam being such a cheap technique, hasn‚Äôt really decreased at all in volume. What happened is that spam filters now use machine learning and are able to train themselves on what legitimate e-mail and spam look like, decreasing false positives and greatly avoiding the chances of getting a spam e-mail in your inbox, but spammers haven‚Äôt ever stopped trying, and it doesn‚Äôt look like the problem is going to go away soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, I came up with a technique that would dramatically decrease received spam volume, and, at the same time, hold the companies that sell your data accountable. Actually, it has many benefits, because it also increases privacy, by making the collection and discovery of accounts impossible by just trying e-mails from public breach dumps, and eliminates the chance of having your online accounts breached even with password reuse (but seriously, do &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; reuse your passwords, ever).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It all started because I used to have two e-mail addresses. A ‚Äúspammy‚Äù one I would use to sign up for fishy stuff, or for websites that required me to log in to see their content. The other ‚Äúgood‚Äù would be my personal e-mail address, and I would use it only to sign up for trustworthy websites and give away to people so they can contact me. By ‚Äútrustworthy‚Äù websites I mean companies that are relatively well established, such as Facebook, Twitter, Valve, Apple, you name it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, turns out big companies also have data breaches. So my ‚Äúgood‚Äù e-mail address eventually ended up in public data leaks, and spam e-mail would start to flow in. Even though it was a Gmail account, and Google is rather great at stopping e-mail, I was still annoyed, mostly by the fact I didn‚Äôt really know who betrayed me and gave my e-mail address away! (Or simply got breached). The worst thing is that if I attended to conferences, for example, a few months later I would start receiving unsolicited e-mail, not only from the organisers of the conference, but even from companies I didn‚Äôt even know about, which I knew came from one of those conferences, but I couldn‚Äôt prove it or specify exactly which of these conferences gave my e-mail address away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can all agree giving away your customer‚Äôs information for marketing purposes is pretty despicable and shameless, but companies keep doing it because you can‚Äôt really know who did it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if you had a different e-mail address for every single service you signed up for? Well, even with password managers, signing up for a single Gmail account can take a few minutes, don‚Äôt even imagine having to go through that process every single time you sign up for a website you might not use ever again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there had to be a better way‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;catch-all-domains&quot;&gt;Catch-all domains&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution I came up with didn‚Äôt require any more time than what‚Äôs typical when signing up for an online service, and shouldn‚Äôt necessarily cost more than 10 dollars a year (if you already have your own e-mail server), but it had a profound impact in how I approach sign-ups nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basically, I purchased a domain I would use exclusively for e-mail. It needed to be sort and legible, so .com domains were out of the question, but the introduction of new TLDs have greatly decreased the chances of having your favourite domain name taken by &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybersquatting&quot;&gt;domain squatters&lt;/a&gt;, as you only have to choose a different TLD if the domain name you want is taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I had to configure my e-mail server to accept mails from said domain, and have it redirect all e-mails to my actual inbox. Since replying from each address was not necessary, I didn‚Äôt have to set up individual accounts on my mail server. If I ever need to reply to someone‚Äôs e-mail, I reply with my personal e-mail address.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I can quickly identify where e-mail comes from, and if a company decides to sell my data to spammers, I will know immediately just by looking at the address it was sent to. For example, imagine my e-mail domain is ‚Äúspameater.online‚Äù (hint: It isn‚Äôt). If I sign up for Twitter as ‚Äútwitter@spameater.online‚Äù, and suddenly start receiving viagra ads addressed to ‚Äútwitter@spameater.online‚Äù, I‚Äôll know Twitter betrayed me, and I can decide to close my account there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now comes the best part. Since no real accounts were created to handle all the incoming e-mail traffic, if I start receiving spam at any of the addresses, blocking e-mail traffic is as easy as having my server (Postfix) drop all incoming e-mail for any address I want. Problem solved, my other e-mail addresses are not published (yet), so there‚Äôs no need to worry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a side benefit, like I said before, even if I shared passwords across services, hackers would be unable to log in, because the e-mail address I use in every service is different. Obviously, if I used simply &lt;nameoftheservice&gt;@spameater.online, it wouldn't be very difficult for a determined attacker to breach into my accounts by changing the e-mail address, so instead of that, to make things even more difficult, I use alphanumeric combinations of variable length as usernames, like 1b7dp64aafg6@spameater.online for Twitter, 454gy4nm6a@spameater.online for Facebook, and m93c1@spameater.online for iCloud, and save the e-mail address and password to my password manager.&lt;/nameoftheservice&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The results have been dramatically positive. In the last 2 years I have been using this experiment, I have received exactly 0 (&lt;strong&gt;ZERO&lt;/strong&gt;) spam e-mails, although, in all honesty, I do apply all the technologies mentioned at the top of the article, so spammers already have a hard time spamming me, with the catch-all domain feature being just another layer I can quickly and effectively disable for specific addresses.&lt;/p&gt;

Probably more than a year. And I haven‚Äôt really had the time to spend trying to break into the machines, because of my university studies, but now summer is coming, so I will be able to dedicate more resources to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In case you don‚Äôt know the website, it‚Äôs a collection of vulnerable virtual machines that are designed to be hacked. It‚Äôs kind of a CTF (Capture The Flag) competition. Actually, even joining the website is a CTF challenge (sorry, I‚Äôm not giving away hints).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In about 30 minutes, I managed my first user own,  with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/machines/profile/132&quot;&gt;Poison&lt;/a&gt; machine by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/11060&quot;&gt;Charix&lt;/a&gt;. To be completely honest, it was disappointingly easy. Disappointing in an unrealistic manner, as in: No real system administrator would set up his username account like that. So easy, in fact, I was able to obtain a shell in very little time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In any case, I‚Äôm now stuck on the second step: Obtaining root privileges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most machines are set up like that: You need to gain user privileges, and then root privileges. You prove this by providing what‚Äôs called a ‚Äúflag‚Äù. This flag is a secret string that you‚Äôre able to read only after you have reached the required privilege level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I intend to dedicate at least one hour daily to learning security tools and breaking into HackTheBox machines (preferably, much, much more, especially during the summer).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/1904&quot;&gt;follow me&lt;/a&gt;, and message me.

Focused on binary (dis)assembly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time it‚Äôs about how different compilers turn high-level programming language code into low-level assembly code, in regards to function calling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a sample, I‚Äôll use a pseudocode call like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;test(a,b,c,d)&lt;/code&gt; to demonstrate how it would look like in regards to different conventions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;push&lt;/code&gt; is a pseudoinstruction that subtracts 4 from the stack pointer (ESP), and then writes the value onto the memory ESP points to. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;pop&lt;/code&gt; is the opposite: reads from the address ESP points to, and then adds 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;cdecl&quot;&gt;cdecl&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs used by many C compilers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Linux, the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) sets the cdecl de facto standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conditions&quot;&gt;Conditions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The registers ST0 through ST7 are empty when calling a function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ST1 through ST7 are empty upon exiting a function, and if no floating point is returned, ST0 is empty too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;arguments-and-return-values&quot;&gt;Arguments and return values&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguments are passed on the stack, right-to-left (C style).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For returns, integers and memory addresses are in EAX, whereas floating points will be in the ST0 x87 register.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;clean-up&quot;&gt;Clean-up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Registers EAX, ECX and EDX are caller-saved, and the rest are callee-saved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stack pointer (ESP) is cleaned by the caller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pseudocode-assembly&quot;&gt;Pseudocode assembly&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-nasm highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;esp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result will be in EAX, and floating point values in ST*.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;syscall&quot;&gt;syscall&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similar to cdecl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs the convention for the 32 bit OS/2 API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;arguments-and-return-values-1&quot;&gt;Arguments and return values&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguments are passed on the stack, right-to-left (C style). The size of the parameter list in doublewords is passed in AL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Return values are in EAX.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;clean-up-1&quot;&gt;Clean-up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ECX, and EDX are cleared upon exiting the function call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The stack pointer (ESP) is cleaned by the caller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pseudocode-assembly-1&quot;&gt;Pseudocode assembly&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-nasm highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;al&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;esp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;al&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result will be in EAX, and floating point values in ST*.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;microsoft-fastcall&quot;&gt;Microsoft fastcall&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This convention is better than the previous two in terms of performance, hence its ‚Äúfast‚Äù prefix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the fastcall convention is not standarised, and varies a lot from compiler to compiler, so I‚Äôll focus in the Microsoft implementation. In this case, GCC‚Äôs &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;__msfastcall&lt;/code&gt; is similar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;arguments-and-return-values-2&quot;&gt;Arguments and return values&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First two arguments are passed left-to-right into ECX and EDX. The remaining arguments are pushed onto the stack from right to left.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft compilers behave differently for IA64 and AMD64 architectures, because of additional registers. They simply use their own x64 calling convention, regardless of what was specified to the compiler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;clean-up-2&quot;&gt;Clean-up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The callee is responsible for cleaning the stack, as well as the ECX and EDX registers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pseudocode-assembly-2&quot;&gt;Pseudocode assembly&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-nasm highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ecx&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;   &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;edx&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;test&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not exactly a tool, but a collection of tools, as the name implies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few interesting ones:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sigcheck&lt;/strong&gt;: Shows file version number, timestamp and digital signature details, and optionally allows for VirusTotal sample uploads.&lt;/li&gt;

We live in an era of permanent distraction. Companies use loud, aggressive marketing in the form of advertisements to grab your attention and get you to buy whatever it is they‚Äôre selling. Our smartphones have become distraction devices that instead of boosting our productivity, and increase our focus, are loaded of applications that send notifications indiscriminately, connecting us to real-time events instantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over time, we have been lured as a society towards a new norm of instant information and notifications, and as individuals, it has become increasingly more difficult to enjoy silence and quietness in our daily lives. The rise of buzzling, cosmopolitan and ecletic cities, full of people and cars all day every day means everything is now more accessible and reachable than ever. We seem to be more connected than ever, at the cost of our personal selves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is clearly torpedoing our deep focus ability and impacting our mental performance. That‚Äôs why silence sanctuaries have been created, such as libraries, and noise pollution laws regulate and restrict noise in different areas and times of the day. This has lead to warning signs that constantly remind us of remaining quiet in these silence zones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need silence to focus and relax. In fact, noise pollution can have a tremendously negative impact in our health, and knowingly or not, we contribute to generating noise every day. It is urgent that we learn to accept and appreciate silence. For the benefit of our community and our own selves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Yates said: ‚ÄúNever say anything that doesn‚Äôt improve on silence.‚Äù, and that‚Äôs a great start. I try to keep small talk and non-constructive criticism away, as I don‚Äôt believe they bring anything of value. But I also try not to make noise, in general, when, for example, moving furniture, or when having a phone conversation (that is, I don‚Äôt maintain conversations in small, enclosed spaces, like buses or trains).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‚ÄúThe quieter you become, the more you can hear.‚Äù - Ram Dass.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Le√≥n Castillejos</name><email>L1Cafe-github@tuta.io</email></author><category term="opinion" /><summary type="html">I find silence to be grossly underestimated.

seemed to study, my grades didn‚Äôt reflect it. I was quite stubborn in believing
I wasn‚Äôt at fault, like some kind of genius who nobody understood, and reading
quotes like this one certainly didn‚Äôt help me understand it was actually my
problem. I was in denial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2018-05-20-productivity/a.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years, I simply resorted to blame the ‚Äúunfair education system‚Äù that was
‚Äúgrading my performance on subjective exams‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While in general I was a visual learner and had much better results with
topics based on practice rather than an abstract understanding of the field,
like what happens in Math. It‚Äôs also true I was not applying the best
methodologies and wasting a lot of time in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve learned a lot in the last years and I‚Äôve managed to drastically change how
I approach learning, resulting in much better performance. It wasn‚Äôt easy, and
I‚Äôm still tuning a lot of behaviours and situations that aren‚Äôt adequately
handled yet, but I‚Äôve come a long way, from being one of the lowest graded
students to being one of the best graded students, often the top in some
subjects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took effort and dedication, but the results are so worth it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My inspiration began with the following video:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E7jWLtdnlfM?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scott Young, the author, is one of the most brilliant minds I‚Äôve ever known, and
his dedication to learning and improving productivity have always fascinated me.
Near the end of the post, I‚Äôll recommend some great books he has published on
becoming a better learner, and improving productivity in general that have
helped me achieve my goals enormously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like him, I‚Äôve always loved computers. Ever since I was 5 years old, I was sure
I wanted to become a computer engineer. And Computer Science is one of the
hardest routes you can take in education, just like pursuing pure math,
theoretical physics, or medicine degrees. Science in general, is not for
everybody. It requires passion, dedication, and curiosity. When I watched that
video, my grades were already at an all-time-low, with no signs of ever
recovering, so I needed to take action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope my experience and trajectory will help others achieve their goals in life
no matter what they are currently studying. This is why I wanted to share this
with you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-doesnt-work&quot;&gt;What doesn‚Äôt work&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;spending-entire-afternoons-in-the-library&quot;&gt;Spending entire afternoons in the library&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some people are lead to believe (and I was too) that spending lots of hours in
the library will eventually lead to good grades, the problem is that, let‚Äôs be
honest, nobody likes being trapped in a building, just to force themselves to
read their books and assignments over and over again, with the hope of magically
recalling it in the middle of the exam. It just doesn‚Äôt work:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;its-been-scientifically-proven-that-the-human-brain-cant-focus-for-long-periods-of-time-in-a-task&quot;&gt;It‚Äôs been scientifically proven that the human brain can‚Äôt focus for long periods of time in a task&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even geniuses like &lt;a href=&quot;https://staciechoice1010.wordpress.com/2014/08/08/focused-vs-diffused-mode/&quot;&gt;Salvador Dal√≠&lt;/a&gt;
took advantage of the way our brains work to vastly improve their learning
abilities by taking short breaks and making use of the focused and diffused
modes of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;willpower-is-not-unlimited&quot;&gt;Willpower is not unlimited&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, no matter how committed you are to simply not check your cellphone
during study hours (or just wander off watching the birds fly or the kids
playing in the street), that will not work. What will end up happening is you
getting very tired, and associating studying with excruciating work that you
really want to avoid. So instead of relying on willpower to achieve your goals,
you must learn to use your time effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-multiple-colours-to-mark-your-notes&quot;&gt;Using multiple colours to mark your notes&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2018-05-20-productivity/colour-coding.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some ‚Äúexperts‚Äù recommend you use different highlighter marker pens to ‚Äúdecorate‚Äù
your notebook, and highlight the important features in a text. While it looks
great, it also does not work at all. Reading, re-reading and marking your notes
will do nothing for you, because it‚Äôs a passive action that requires little to
no effort by you, just like reading a newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;studying-in-groups&quot;&gt;Studying in groups&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also a technique I used to apply, but I eventually realised it was
extremely detrimental to my performance. Let me be clear: the problem is not
the group itself, or the people, it‚Äôs the methodology  applied when studying in
a group. If all the members in the group are applying suboptimal studying
techniques, you‚Äôll end up inadvertently acquiring them as well. Especially if
any member in the group is a smoker, what will end up happening is he‚Äôll want to
smoke, and pull members of the group with him to ‚Äútake a break‚Äù. Breaks that
will end up taking 30 or 45 minutes. Seems like a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;relying-only-on-brute-force-memory&quot;&gt;Relying only on brute-force memory&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trying to cram an entire subject in memory will often result in failure. There
are some talented individuals with photographic memory that can manage it, but
in general it‚Äôs not a smart technique, especially because you‚Äôll forget
everything after the exam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;energy-drinks-and-sugary-caffeinated-beverages&quot;&gt;Energy drinks and sugary, caffeinated beverages&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2018-05-20-productivity/monster-energy.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course they taste great, they are specifically designed for that!
And they promise energy and focus for athletes, what could go wrong? Well,
actually, many things.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2014.00134/full&quot;&gt;Very reputable sources&lt;/a&gt;
have long been wary of the adverse health effects these beverages produce. Even
if they are socially acceptable, they still contain acid, insane amounts of
sugar, and big quantities of caffeine that harm your body. Do your own research
and come to your own conclusions. I‚Äôve personally banned energy drinks from my
life, and may only occasionally consume a cup of coffee every now and then. But
not because I‚Äôm a coffee-junkie and I ‚Äúneed‚Äù my cup of coffee in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;denial&quot;&gt;Denial&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I was many years ago. Just living in denial and blaming everyone else for
my own bad results. Teachers, the education system, politicians‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs not
going to help anybody, and it‚Äôs especially not going to help you achieve your
goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-did-work&quot;&gt;What did work&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my years of applying wrong and correct techniques, coming up with my own
ones, researching, and reading books on the topic, I‚Äôve been able to discern the
positive or negative results they bring, and here are a few of them&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interval-working&quot;&gt;Interval-working&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like I said before, working endlessly on a project will only lead to a drastic
performance decrease the more continued time you spend focused in it. A very
efficient method, however, is dividing the time into small portions
characterised by a constant focus and strong concentration, and small breaks to
activate the diffused mode of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;focused-and-diffused-modes&quot;&gt;Focused and diffused modes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a
&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.brainscape.com/blog/2016/08/better-learning-focused-vs-diffuse-thinking/&quot;&gt;well researched topic&lt;/a&gt;
which can be explained by the ability our brains have to quickly switch
contexts. Apparently, even after you stop focusing on a hard problem, go relax
and read a book, take a walk, or drink some tea, the brain will keep processing
the knowledge in the background, but in a much more diffuse way, which can lead
to breakthroughs in understanding a particularly complex topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-pomodoro-technique&quot;&gt;The Pomodoro technique&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2018-05-20-productivity/pomodoro.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A trademark of
&lt;a href=&quot;https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique&quot;&gt;Francesco Cirillo&lt;/a&gt;, he
designed and applied a technique that, in short (you can get more information
in the link I provided), designs a time schedule divided in chunks of 25
minutes, followed by short 5 minute breaks, and longer, 20-30 minute breaks
every four intervals. It‚Äôs definitely an interesting technique, that takes a bit
of time to get used to. It‚Äôs very important you follow the technique as-is, even
if you‚Äôre performing great and don‚Äôt feel tired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;my-own-technique&quot;&gt;My own technique&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ended up modifying the Pomodoro technique to adapt it to my way. My way is 60
minutes of focus, deep work, and 15 minutes of relaxation. After every 2 or 3
intervals, I take longer 30-45 minute breaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chunking-and-recalling&quot;&gt;Chunking and recalling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only effective way to tackle a difficult problem optimally is to break it up
into small, understandable parts. For example, in math, to compute the
determinant of a matrix, first you need to master the Reduced Row Echelon Form,
and learn how the different operations affect the end result of a determinant;
like the swapping of two rows inverting its symbol. Once you have managed all
the small chunks, you can proceed to complete the puzzle, and this time will be
much easier than you remember.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recalling refers to trying to remember small amounts of information on a
(chunked) topic. A great example of this are flashcards. This works very well
for remembering historic events, learning foreign languages (particularly those
based in Chinese characters or similar that form words with 1-3 characters
only), or remembering complex physics formulas. Simply write a very concise and
clear question in a piece of paper, and write the answer on the other side. Make
some flashcards and then, try to answer correctly before flipping them to see
the answer. Keep repeating this daily, for just a few minutes (or every few
days), and you‚Äôll see your memory capacity skyrocket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;interleaving&quot;&gt;Interleaving&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Supported on the previous method of chunking, this consists in mixing two
different disciplines (they don‚Äôt need to be related), like for example, mixing
linear algebra and algorithm analysis, by studying a 30 minutes of both in each
60 minute sprint before my break. Or maybe study 3 subjects and give each 20
minutes. This works surprisingly well because when you‚Äôre working on a different
discipline, new ideas and insights may pop up inadvertently, from the previous
discipline. At first, it will seem really difficult and may even slow you down,
but the secret is that when you‚Äôre doing this, you‚Äôre interconnecting different
chunks related to different subjects, and physically modifying your brain by
creating neural connections, making it much easier to recall down the road.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mnemonics-and-visual-memory&quot;&gt;Mnemonics and ‚Äúvisual memory‚Äù&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When trying to master a difficult topic, brute-force memorising leads to a very
bland understanding of the topic at hand. If instead, you try to come up with
mnemonic rules and apply visual memory to abstract concepts, recalling them
down the road will be much easier, as they will be tied with other memories, and
will form a bigger cluster of chunks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;method-of-ioci-memory-palace&quot;&gt;Method of Ioci (memory palace)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method consists in visually imagining a place, like your living
room, bedroom, or bathroom, and embedding knowledge in the environment. For
example: imagine trying to learn European history, on how Adolf Hitler shaped
WWII. What you can do is come up with a big hotel in which each room is a
different year, you open room 1939, and you see the German invasion of Poland,
and you also see how Britain and France declare war on Germany. On room 1940,
Germany invades Denmark and Norway, and bombs London. This way, you can keep
imagining the rooms of the hotel, and even combine it with the flashcard method
for ultra-efficient learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gather-alternative-material-to-support-your-subjects&quot;&gt;Gather alternative material to support your subjects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While a great teacher is often the difference between passing and failing
grades, a better student knows how to research difficult topics to acquire a
broad perspective on it, and complements the classroom learning with excellent
books that support the topic. Teachers will often be happy to provide references
to great books, and some professors will even write books themselves. If you‚Äôre
studying on your own, or, for some reason, can‚Äôt seem to find adequate material,
you can always look up other universities that teach the subject of your choice
and read the Teaching Guide for bilbiographic references, or simply search for
MOOCs on the topic and try to complete them simultaneously with your lessons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;surround-yourself-with-the-best&quot;&gt;Surround yourself with the best&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jim Rohn said ‚ÄúYou are the average of the five people you spend the most time
with‚Äù. And, in a way, if you‚Äôre surrounded with average people, it‚Äôs going to be
generally easy to stay on top. Things aren‚Äôt so easy when your friends are
constantly challenging you intellectually, as you‚Äôll be pushed by peer pressure
to become better at it. It‚Äôs a great motivator, and you can learn a lot from
people who know more than you on a certain topic. In fact, sometimes, the
relationship can be symbiotic, in that you know more about a topic X, and they
know more about a topic Y, and so each other‚Äôs knowledge complements both
perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;abandon-perfection&quot;&gt;Abandon perfection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Often times, I found myself striving for such perfection, it got in the way of
my performance. For example, my essays have always been of comparatively high
quality when compared with my classmates. Not only they had a lot of great
content, the presentation was also excellent. The problem here is that I used to
spend way too much time on presentation, even from the very beginning, and I
should have elaborated a short summary of ideas in the form of a quick and dirty
sketch, and improved the visual aspect later down the road, this allows for much
greater flexibility when researching a given topic, and less combined time
worrying about the placement of elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;white-noise&quot;&gt;White noise&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2018-05-20-productivity/white-noise.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I live in a very noisy environment, and often, noises would disturb my focus,
because everything is so quiet, and suddenly even a sheet of paper falling to
the ground is very audible. This is because the brain gets used to the silence,
and when it is broken, it places focus in that new, abnormal event. White noise
improves concentration by raising the noise floor, so that subtle noises get
masked in the continuous stream of white noise. White noise is a random signal
that has the property of having equal intensity at different frequencies. A
great website I contribute to is &lt;a href=&quot;https://mynoise.net/&quot;&gt;myNoise&lt;/a&gt;, which has a
plethora of different noise generators. I particularly really enjoy white noise
mixed with rain noise. But there are so many different generators, you‚Äôll find
the one you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;learn-another-language&quot;&gt;Learn another language&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Especially important for monoglots, speaking two or three languages, often means
you also have to learn the culture of each respective language. For example:
Japanese people are particularly known to be extremely well-mannered, and this
translates directly into the Japanese language, in how imperative forms are used
(it often is not!), as the Japanese people see command forms as very aggressive,
instead, they make requests, even to people of lower social status, like
bosses to their employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only it opens your mind to different cultures, and gives you an edge when
trying to work abroad, there are also articles that claim
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3164163/It-s-official-Speaking-one-language-makes-smarter-Bilingual-people-grey-matter-know-mother-tongue.html&quot;&gt;being bilingual makes you smarter&lt;/a&gt;
and despite the clearly sensationalist headline, we must not dismiss the facts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I invite you to look it up if you‚Äôre not entirely convinced!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I speak Spanish natively, and very fluent English (almost native), and currently
find myself learning Chinese. I believe it‚Äôs the language of the future, and I‚Äôm
increasingly seeing GitHub repositories entirely written in Chinese. While it‚Äôs

&lt;h2 id=&quot;practicing-sports&quot;&gt;Practicing sports&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, practicing sports brings many benefits, from cardiovascular
performance enhancement, weight loss, endurance enhancement, better sleep, and
many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the very important benefits of practicing sports is related to mental
performance,
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2010/01/11/0911725107&quot;&gt;a study shows&lt;/a&gt; that
running enhances learning and promotes synaptic plasticity (which is the
ability of the brain to shift and change its structure, creating new connections
which is essential for learning). And it‚Äôs not the only one, there‚Äôs tons of
proof that exercising is beneficial, not only to physical wellbeing but also to
the health of the brain. In Latin ‚ÄúMens sana in corpore sano‚Äù means ‚ÄúHealthy
mind in a healthy body‚Äù, so this is nothing new. What are you waiting for to hit
the streets today?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;meditation-and-buddhism&quot;&gt;Meditation and buddhism&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/2018-05-20-productivity/zen.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time I suffered from anger management issues, depression, and
struggled to understand things outside of my context (what‚Äôs called ‚Äúthink out
of the box‚Äù) because I wasn‚Äôt aware of my own self and my surroundings, and just
seemed to let myself go with the flow, like a dead fish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I came in contact with Buddhism a good 10 years ago, and it has literally
changed my life profoundly. I follow the Zen branch of Buddhism, which is the
one that‚Äôs less concerned in deities and religious figures, and instead focuses
heavily on the practice of meditation. Zazen is the primary meditative practice
of Zen Buddhism, and it‚Äôs generally referred to as sitting in silence, as a
means of insight into the nature of existence. There are many meditation
methods, and one in particular I tend to follow is Anapanasati, which literally
means ‚Äúmindfulness of inhalation and exhalation‚Äù, or the practice of watching
your own breath. This is the most well known and probably the easiest technique
to apply for beginners. There are many books and videos on the topic, but
basically it helped me manage my emotions, focus my energy and not waste so much
time procrastinating, among other things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;avoid-overconfidence&quot;&gt;Avoid overconfidence&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It‚Äôs often easy to fall prey to overconfidence, just skimming through the notes
and thinking you know everything, because you can see it all written right
before your eyes. But if you take solved exams, cover the solutions with a piece
of paper, and try solving them without peeking at the solutions, it becomes very
difficult, especially if you have not mastered the topic at hand. This is solved
by practising, using flashcards and the Method of Ioci, for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also take solved exams and work through them with the same restrictions
you‚Äôd have in a real exam: time limit, no notes (well, depending on your
professor‚Äôs rules, some of my college teachers would actually allow us to carry
our notebooks, including textbooks and problem sets), and, when you‚Äôre done,
grade yourself honestly, and see how you did compared to the provided answers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your professors don‚Äôt release solved exams, you can, most of the time, pick
up books from the library with solved problem sets. And best of all, you can
create your own problem sets to challenge your knowledge. Try to solve them
without the course material, and then solve them again using the material
provided, calculators and theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;get-to-know-appreciate-and-love-yourself&quot;&gt;Get to know, appreciate and love yourself&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This may seem obvious, but you need to know yourself, your skills, limits, and
be honest with what you‚Äôre good and bad at (and improve your shortcomings!). And
most importantly, don‚Äôt beat yourself for not being good enough. Nobody is born
knowing everything. It‚Äôs true some people have some learning advantages compared
to you, and some other people also have disabilities. Don‚Äôt let that stop you
from pushing yourself to the limit, and becoming a better yourself tomorrow than
you were yesterday. There‚Äôs only one way, and that way is forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;passion-and-ambition&quot;&gt;Passion and ambition&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm very passionate, and I‚Äôve always strived for the best, giving the most of
myself in whatever it is I‚Äôm doing. I‚Äôm determined to leave a positive impact in
this world, that will last for long after I‚Äôm gone. And the only way to achieve
this is to be determined to improve yourself every day, to see the best in
yourself and others, and not settle for less. I believe people without passion
cannot achieve success in life. Because, to be successful, you first have to
want it. And not just wish it passively, but work on your goals and dreams every
day. Fortunately, in this day and age, it‚Äôs easy to find your passion, and
pursue it into college. In Europe, education is cheap and of great quality. In
the USA, education is not that cheap, but you can get grants. In general, the
quality of the national educational systems have improved vastly worldwide, and
with the introduction of the Internet, Wikipedia and MOOCs, it‚Äôs easier than
ever to achieve knowledge excellence, even for free. Like a certain brand of
sport clothing says: ‚ÄúJust do it.‚Äù. Excuses are for quitters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;learn-more&quot;&gt;Learn more&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are lots of books and courses dedicated to teaching you to become a better
and more efficient learner. I‚Äôve reviewed some of them, and most of my findings
and insight comes from them. Over the years I‚Äôve also developed some personal
techniques that I have enumerated, but bear in mind, they work for me, and they
dont necessarily have to apply to you. It would be a much better idea to develop
your own techniques based on your own experience and insight: much like I did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are my references:&lt;/p&gt;

VSCode, but after learning Vim, and finding many problems with my plug-ins, on
different languages (such as MIPS assembly, Java and VHDL), I decided to give
VSCode a try, and I have been very impressed by how well Visual Studio Code
works. It‚Äôs much faster than JS-based editors used to be, it has amazing
community support, and I‚Äôm generally faster, and more productive using it. It 
has fixed a lot of its shortcomings, like its speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it‚Äôs been a few months since I first started using VSCode, and I found a few
extensions that I really like now and use often. Here are some of them:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;auto-close-tag&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-close-tag&quot;&gt;Auto Close Tag&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://L1Cafe.github.io/assets/images/2018-05-14-my-vscode-extensions/autoclosetag.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very useful extension for web development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;beautify&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HookyQR.beautify&quot;&gt;Beautify&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much more powerful than the js-beautify built into VSCode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;better-comments&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments&quot;&gt;Better Comments&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://L1Cafe.github.io/assets/images/2018-05-14-my-vscode-extensions/bettercomments.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When a project size grows, keeping track of things to do, questions, and other
special comments you leave in the code to improve readability can quickly become
a challenge. This extension essentially proposes a few tiers of comments you
can use to categorise comments and notes, so it‚Äôs easier to keep track of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;code-runner&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner&quot;&gt;Code Runner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This extension supports running code with custom commands, as well as running
fragments of source code in a file, for lots of programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;devskim&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-DevSkim.vscode-devskim&quot;&gt;DevSkim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great extension that detects lots of common mistakes that may result in security
issues, such as plain HTTP links, secrets and tokens stored in plain text,
 disabled certificate validation, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;docker&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PeterJausovec.vscode-docker&quot;&gt;Docker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://L1Cafe.github.io/assets/images/2018-05-14-my-vscode-extensions/docker.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adds functionality for automatic Dockerfile generation, syntax highlighting
for docker files, IntelliSense, linting, the ability to deploy images
directly from VSCode and more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;editorconfig&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig&quot;&gt;EditorConfig&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This extension is based on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://editorconfig.org&quot;&gt;EditorConfig&lt;/a&gt; standard
which aims to maintain consistency across environments where code is shared,
even when different people editing the same file are using different editors,
by abstracting and overriding common settings such as tab spacing, charsets, and
such.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;git-history&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.githistory&quot;&gt;Git History&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://L1Cafe.github.io/assets/images/2018-05-14-my-vscode-extensions/git_history.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allows you to browse any git repository graphically, compare branches, commits,
as well as perform merges, revert commits, view GitHub avatars‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;git-lens&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens&quot;&gt;Git Lens&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adds many features, like inline blame (to see who edited what line, and when), 
opening commit directly in GitHub, view diff from commit and current file, and 
more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;gruvbox-themes&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tomphilbin.gruvbox-themes&quot;&gt;Gruvbox Themes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://L1Cafe.github.io/assets/images/2018-05-14-my-vscode-extensions/gruvbox.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Definitely my favourite theme: The light version is not completely white, but 
beige, which is much more pleasant to see even in dark environments, but it also
 ships with a dark theme which uses the same color scheme. It has good contrast 
while at the same time not being soft enough to use for hours on end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;ip-address&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Compulim.vscode-ipaddress&quot;&gt;IP Address&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://L1Cafe.github.io/assets/images/2018-05-14-my-vscode-extensions/ip.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shows your IP address in the status bar, which helps greatly when using a laptop
 and moving around often, as you don‚Äôt need to pull up a terminal or a web 
browser to check your IP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;jekyll-snippets&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ginfuru.vscode-jekyll-snippets&quot;&gt;Jekyll Snippets&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helpful when dealing with Jekyll websites (did you know this website runs on 
Jekyll and is completely static?) which is my favourite static site generator. 
Adds features such as syntax highlighting for Jekyll Front Matter, as well as 
ERB snippets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;nightswitch-lite&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gharveymn.nightswitch-lite&quot;&gt;NightSwitch-Lite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Toggles to light/dark themes as specified in your configuration automatically 
based on the time of day and location, but it also allows to manually set the 
switching time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;vim&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim&quot;&gt;Vim&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adds modal editing, Vim shortcuts, command remapping, and some popular Vim 
plugins like EasyMotion, Surround, and such.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Le√≥n Castillejos</name><email>L1Cafe-github@tuta.io</email></author><category term="software-dev" /><category term="Microsoft" /><summary type="html">At first, I really disliked Electron and JS-based text editors, like Atom and VSCode, but after learning Vim, and finding many problems with my plug-ins, on different languages (such as MIPS assembly, Java and VHDL), I decided to give VSCode a try, and I have been very impressed by how well Visual Studio Code works.

I am convinced it is the superior desktop OS, but I also think everyone should use what suits them. In my case, that would be macOS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;its-familiar&quot;&gt;It‚Äôs familiar&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though I‚Äôve been using macOS for less than 6 months so far, I find it a very familiar and comfortable experience. Apart from the GUI, which may take a little bit to get used to, the OS is Unix-like. It ships with bash, vim, and many POSIX utilities, this means I can apply my ample experience with Unix-like OSes, such as different Linux and BSD distributions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;lots-of-commercial-software-available&quot;&gt;Lots of commercial software available&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love and use Linux regularly. I think it‚Äôs a very solid operating system for the desktop, but the truth is‚Ä¶ It just doesn‚Äôt suit my needs sometimes. Sure, there are open-source alternatives to most commercial software, for example, GIMP is an Adobe Photoshop alternative, LMMS is a Fruity Loops/Logic Pro alternative, Inkscape is an Adobe Illustrator alternative, LibreOffice is a Microsoft Office alternative‚Ä¶ But the reality is that these tools aren‚Äôt up to speed and lack many features that make working with them unproductive. One example is the lack of non-destructive filters on GIMP, LMMS doesn‚Äôt have nearly as many third party commercial plug-ins as the other two, LibreOffice has a TERRIBLE user interface (although this seems to be improving), and this lack of features is generally true for most open-source software. Even if I like open-source, and really want to use it and discard closed-source software, it simply doesn‚Äôt work for me. I‚Äôm less productive on open-source software than on their closed-source counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;great-trackpad&quot;&gt;Great trackpad&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MacBooks have brilliant trackpads. Considering they are the primary input device on laptops, this is a huge deal. Before this MacBook, I used to carry a little mouse around because that trackpad was simply atrocious. Now I like it so much, I actually prefer it. It‚Äôs much more precise, and with its huge surface area combined with accurate palm rejection, I really have no need for a mouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;usb-c-all-the-things&quot;&gt;USB-C all the things!&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People complain because this laptop has no ‚Äúnormal USB ports‚Äù. What they are referring to is ‚ÄúUSB type A ports‚Äù, which are very badly designed (non-reversable), big, bulky, and obsolete. USB-C (actually, Thunderbolt 3), supports Ethernet networking, power delivery, video output, USB 3.1, digital and analog audio‚Ä¶ I can charge my computer or output video from any of the 4 ports. USB-C is the future, and a USB-C to USB-A adaptor isn‚Äôt expensive, in case I need to use legacy hardware. I want this laptop to last me a while. In 5 years, nobody will be using USB-A, and people will carry that port on their older laptops like some still carry VGA, HDMI and ethernet ports around.Thunderbolt 3 does all this and much more, including external GPUs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;theres-no-linux-laptop-alternative&quot;&gt;There‚Äôs no Linux laptop alternative&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I paid good money for this laptop, but I‚Äôm very willing to pay even more for a better Linux laptop. It simply does not exist. Sure, there are companies like System76 which build very powerful laptops, but, let‚Äôs be honest, their design is ugly as hell. And, after a little investigation, I found that other laptops may outperform the Mac in a certain area, but not all. For example: One might be better at battery, but only because it has a Core i7 U CPU, which offers poor performance for my needs. Other computer might have a beefier GPU, but also be much more thicker, I carry this laptop everyday and I don‚Äôt appreciate any extra weight, my back suffers. Other laptop could have a much higher resolution 4K touch screen, but also be made out of creaky plastic. Hell no!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I love POSIX and Unix, and this is as close as I can get while also owning good quality hardware. I don‚Äôt wish to use Windows. Windows is an objectively inferior OS, and Microsoft‚Äôs pathetic attempts at attracting Linux users by including a Bash shell and some other stuff are definitely not enticing me to use Windows if I can help it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;apple-is-global&quot;&gt;Apple is global&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where I live, the only Microsoft Surface product I can buy are the non-Book variants. There are very good Samsung laptops, but they don‚Äôt sell in Europe anymore. Razer has a great laptop: The Razer Blade Stealth, but, again, not available in Spain. Asus, MSI, only sell a few laptops, and, to be honest, their lineup is insane: too many models to choose from, where Apple only offers a few base models, with customisations. Sure, I could probably buy them through Amazon, but I want to buy them on their respective official stores, directly. Even if that means paying a little bit more in shipping prices, I really don‚Äôt want to deal with a third party. Apple allows me to buy every single product on their line-up, both online, and in a physical Apple store. Apple allows me to configure my product with a US ANSI keyboard, which, in my opinion, is a must for us programmers, and that‚Äôs what I have done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only real alternative I have to this MacBook Pro is one of the newest Dell XPS 15, which I can buy on their official online store, but I finally decided on the MacBook Pro because the XPS 15 only supports Windows officially (the Developer Edition, which runs Ubuntu, is an XPS 13 model, too small for my needs).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;its-well-designed&quot;&gt;It‚Äôs well designed&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model I own, the MacBook Pro 2016 15 inch with Touch Bar, has received very tough criticism for a few things, and I would like to comment on that:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;battery-life&quot;&gt;Battery life&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This machine has received lots of hate due to some people claiming ridiculous battery runtimes: As low as 4 hours of continuous use. Battery life was something Apple used to be proud of, MacBooks have always maintained a great balance of processing power, and thickness, so some people were worried and annoyed this MacBook performed worse than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This has not been my experience, however. This machine lasts me from 8 to 11 hours of usage, editing code, compiling, and even opening virtual machines, but it‚Äôs true that when I use the GPU intensively, battery life decreases significantly faster than before, this is because the GPU is a very power-hungry AMD card, which, by the way, also produces a lot of heat, that must be quickly dissipated by the integrated fans. This is expected behaviour, as GPUs consume more power than CPUs when working hard, so, if you‚Äôre editing video, you‚Äôll see worse battery life, obviously, but, think again: Do you &lt;strong&gt;REALLY&lt;/strong&gt; need to edit video on the go? If I were to edit video, I‚Äôd be in a room, with a wall plug nearby, probably, so I don‚Äôt think this is an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;butterfly-2-keyboard&quot;&gt;Butterfly 2 keyboard&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the Apple Butterfly keyboard mechanism was first launched (on the standard MacBook), many people disliked it due to the lack of feedback: Me included. It feels as if you were typing on a glass surface, and because there‚Äôs basically no key travel, fingers hurt after a while in my experience, due to the fingers constantly hitting a hard surface. Butterfly 2 is much different, though. It has a very satisfying, but not obnoxiously loud clicking feel. The key travel has been improved, although not dramatically, but enough for me to love it. I‚Äôm starting to like it even more than my Cherry Red mechanical keyboard, and I‚Äôve used this for more than 10 years now! I would definitely like to see this mechanism on more keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;touch-bar&quot;&gt;Touch Bar&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not only it allows you to perform certain quick commands easier (such as clicking ‚ÄúOK‚Äù or ‚Äúcancel‚Äù on typical dialog boxes, accessing your bookmarked sites on Safari, switching tools on Affinity Photo, Pixelmator, Apple Pages, Microsoft Word, etc), but it also adds an extra layer of security. Because the Touch Bar has its own isolated CPU, it cannot be infected by normal means, and only talks to the OS through a dedicated bus (USB I believe), it means authentication dialogs cannot be forged, especially the ones that ask for your fingerprint, like on the App Store, which, by the way, is a very fast and convenient way of authenticating the user, and also allows for quick unlocking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lack of function keys is irrelevant, as the Touch Bar provides a far quicker and flexible way of operating the computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;it-simply-is-pretty&quot;&gt;It simply is pretty&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is that design is a very important part of productivity: a study found that when people worked in well designed offices, and used nicely designed hardware and appliances, were much more productive than on ugly environments and devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Le√≥n Castillejos</name><email>L1Cafe-github@tuta.io</email></author><category term="opinion" /><category term="Apple" /><summary type="html">In this article, I want to explain why I use a MacBook.

Identity theft, e-mail confirmations, instant notifications, mobile devices, multiple accounts, data leaks, account dumps, service breaches, malware that steals your bank‚Äôs information, scammers, identity theft‚Ä¶&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have ever read basic security and privacy tips you might be aware of some basic points:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don‚Äôt share your password with anyone, especially people claiming to be employees of these companies.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Always use hard to guess and long passwords, combining symbols, uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and never reuse them across services.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don‚Äôt use obvious passwords such as your e-mail address, your name, your wife‚Äôs name, your birthdate or words like ‚Äúpassword‚Äù or ‚Äú1234‚Äù.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enable two factor authentication when possible, this adds an extra layer which, in case your password gets stolen, will make it more difficult to gain unauthorised access to your account.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do a regular check-up of your online accounts, and change passwords.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These tips, while valid, are sometimes difficult to accomplish. Nowadays, almost every online service asks us to make an account, so that will be another new password we‚Äôll need to remember. As we sign up for more and more services, this becomes more and more unlikely until we reach the point of simply using the same password or using variations that are difficult for computers to guess but easy for human attackers, like changing Os for zeroes, or intentionally misspelling words (like writing ‚Äútwtter‚Äù instead of ‚Äútwitter‚Äù). This is not very wise, but fortunately, we have a better tool: password managers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, I will summarise a few options regarding password management, sorted by popularity ranking as per &lt;a href=&quot;https://alternativeto.net/&quot;&gt;AlternativeTo&lt;/a&gt; ratings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-most-well-known&quot;&gt;The most well known&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lastpass&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lastpass.com/&quot;&gt;LastPass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://L1Cafe.github.io/assets/images/2017-03-21-password-managers/lastpass.png&quot; alt=&quot;LastPass' interface&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably the most famous password manager. Released in 2008, their team of experts deliver a cross-platform experience, with extensions for the most used browsers, but also for less well known browsers like Vivaldi, Maxthon or Dolphin. Can work independently of the operating system because it can be used as a browser extension, so all you need is a compatible browser, and you can carry your passwords wherever you go. There are also applications for Android, iPhone, iPad, Windows Phone, etc. The premium plan, at 1 USD/month is rather affordable. It also has a few extra features, such as one that watches websites for breaches and notifies you if you have a stored password for a website that may have been compromised, or a password change wizard that allows for semi-automated fast password changing in supported sites that requires very little manual intervention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pros&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Well established&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unified experience across devices&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cloud sync&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Free plan&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Auto-fill features&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can store encrypted files (with limits depending on the plan)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cons&quot;&gt;Cons&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Closed source, so it cannot be independently audited&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cloud-based, local storage or third party sync (like Dropbox) is not feasible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;keepass&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://keepass.info/&quot;&gt;KeePass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://L1Cafe.github.io/assets/images/2017-03-21-password-managers/keepass.png&quot; alt=&quot;KeePass' interface&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It isn‚Äôt exactly an application, but rather, a standard. The application is completely open source and the most used implementation (KeePass), uses the .Net framework on Windows, and Mono on macOS and Linux. Because of its open nature, there are lots of third party implementations such as KeePassX (which uses Qt, much more desirable for non-Windows machines), KeePassDroid, and others. It is absolutely free to use, forever, and it doesn‚Äôt carry a service or cloud with it: it focuses exclusively on password vaults as files. These files can then be easily synchronised using Dropbox, Resilio Sync, or your cloud storage tool of choice. These vaults are encrypted and they can be tuned to use stronger encryption (increasing the open delay, and decreasing the effectiveness of brute-force attacks). KeePass/X allows specifying a key file, a password, or a combination of both, making it a multi-factor solution. There are third party ports for Android, iOS, Windows Phone, Windows Mobile, and even web apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pros-1&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Completely open source&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cross-platform&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fully free&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(Partly) audited&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rudimentary auto-fill&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allows storing arbitrary files inside the database&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cons-1&quot;&gt;Cons&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Does not have cloud sync&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Notably uglier than other solutions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Third party implementations sometimes lack minor functionality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1password&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1password.com/&quot;&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://L1Cafe.github.io/assets/images/2017-03-21-password-managers/1password.png&quot; alt=&quot;1Password's interface&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1Password has long been the prettiest of the bunch. It offers both a subscription based service, and allows paying a single time for a major version and subsequent updates. It has apps for Windows, and Mac, along with Android and iOS, and ships primarily as an app, rather than as a plug-in (although, browser plug-ins are available for integration). It supports a few OS specific features, such as the Touch Bar and the Touch ID on macOS and iOS, fingerprint authentication on Android, and, like LastPass, it has a service that watches for data breaches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;pros-2&quot;&gt;Pros&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Very well-designed interface&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Allows for both cloud and local storage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can store files&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Auto-fill features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;cons-2&quot;&gt;Cons&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A bit pricier than its alternatives, no free plan&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No other desktop OS support besides Windows or macOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-alternatives&quot;&gt;Other alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While less known, there are other ways to manage your passwords.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;encryptr&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://spideroak.com/personal/encryptr&quot;&gt;Encryptr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://L1Cafe.github.io/assets/images/2017-03-21-password-managers/encryptr.png&quot; alt=&quot;Encryptr's interface&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tiny little app that allows for fast password management. It‚Äôs clean-looking, and it‚Äôs cloud-based, so you‚Äôll never lose your passwords. It‚Äôs cross-platform and it uses the Electron framework to bring a unified experience across operating systems. It has apps for Windows, Linux, macOS, as well as Android, iOS. It‚Äôs free and open source. Doesn‚Äôt allow storing files, only plain text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enpass&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.enpass.io/&quot;&gt;Enpass&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://L1Cafe.github.io/assets/images/2017-03-21-password-managers/enpass.png&quot; alt=&quot;Enpass' interface&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A newcomer to the password management industry. It is completely free to use on desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux), but its mobile apps (Android, iOS, Blackberry, Windows Phone, Android Wear, Apple Watch) have a one-time fee. It looks good and allows for both local and third party cloud-based storage. Supports Windows Hello, Touch ID, Android fingerprint, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;true-key&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.truekey.com/&quot;&gt;True Key&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://L1Cafe.github.io/assets/images/2017-03-21-password-managers/truekey.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;True Key's interface&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Backed by Intel, it features biometric authentication, and is free for up to 15 passwords. After that, it requires a yearly subscription to use on Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;master-password&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://masterpasswordapp.com/&quot;&gt;Master Password&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://L1Cafe.github.io/assets/images/2017-03-21-password-managers/masterpassword.png&quot; alt=&quot;Master Password's interface&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This one is a bit different. Instead of saving passwords in a file database or saving them on the cloud, it generates your passwords based on your master password, name, and website, so it never stores data.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Le√≥n Castillejos</name><email>L1Cafe-github@tuta.io</email></author><category term="opinion" /><category term="passwords" /><summary type="html">The Internet nowadays is a very messy place.
