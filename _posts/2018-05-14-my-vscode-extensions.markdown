At first, I really disliked Electron and JS-based text editors, like Atom and
VSCode, but after learning Vim, and finding many problems with my plug-ins, on
different languages (such as MIPS assembly, Java and VHDL), I decided to give
VSCode a try, and I have been very impressed by how well Visual Studio Code
works. It's much faster than JS-based editors used to be, it has amazing
community support, and I'm generally faster, and more productive using it. It 
has fixed a lot of its shortcomings, like its speed.

So it's been a few months since I first started using VSCode, and I found a few
extensions that I really like now and use often. Here are some of them:


# [Auto Close Tag](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.auto-close-tag)

![]({{site.url}}/assets/images/2018-05-14-my-vscode-extensions/autoclosetag.gif)

Very useful extension for web development.

# [Beautify](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HookyQR.beautify)

Much more powerful than the js-beautify built into VSCode.

# [Better Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments)

When a project size grows, keeping track of things to do, questions, and other
special comments you leave in the code to improve readability can quickly become
a challenge. This extension essentially proposes a few tiers of comments you
can use to categorise comments and notes, so it's easier to keep track of them.

# [Code Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner)

This extension supports running code with custom commands, as well as running
fragments of source code in a file, for lots of programming languages.

# [DevSkim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-DevSkim.vscode-devskim)

Great extension that detects lots of common mistakes that may result in security
issues, such as plain HTTP links, secrets and tokens stored in plain text,
 disabled certificate validation, and so on.

# [Docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PeterJausovec.vscode-docker)

![]({{site.url}}/assets/images/2018-05-14-my-vscode-extensions/docker.gif)

Adds functionality for automatic Dockerfile generation, syntax highlighting
for docker files, IntelliSense, linting, the ability to deploy images
directly from VSCode and more.

# [EditorConfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)

This extension is based on the [EditorConfig](http://editorconfig.org) standard
which aims to maintain consistency across environments where code is shared,
even when different people editing the same file are using different editors,
by abstracting and overriding common settings such as tab spacing, charsets, and
such.

# [Git History](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.githistory)

![]({{site.url}}/assets/images/2018-05-14-my-vscode-extensions/git_history.gif)

Allows you to browse any git repository graphically, compare branches, commits,
as well as perform merges, revert commits, view GitHub avatars...

# [Git Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eamodio.gitlens)

Adds many features, like inline blame (to see who edited what line, and when), 
opening commit directly in GitHub, view diff from commit and current file, and 
more.

# [Gruvbox Themes](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tomphilbin.gruvbox-themes)

![]({{site.url}}/assets/images/2018-05-14-my-vscode-extensions/gruvbox.png)

Definitely my favourite theme: The light version is not completely white, but 
beige, which is much more pleasant to see even in dark environments, but it also
 ships with a dark theme which uses the same color scheme. It has good contrast 
while at the same time not being soft enough to use for hours on end.

# [IP Address](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Compulim.vscode-ipaddress)

![]({{site.url}}/assets/images/2018-05-14-my-vscode-extensions/ip.gif)

Shows your IP address in the status bar, which helps greatly when using a laptop
 and moving around often, as you don't need to pull up a terminal or a web 
browser to check your IP.

# [Jekyll Snippets](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ginfuru.vscode-jekyll-snippets)

Helpful when dealing with Jekyll websites (did you know this website runs on 
Jekyll and is completely static?) which is my favourite static site generator. 
Adds features such as syntax highlighting for Jekyll Front Matter, as well as 
ERB snippets.

# [NightSwitch-Lite](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=gharveymn.nightswitch-lite)

Toggles to light/dark themes as specified in your configuration automatically 
based on the time of day and location, but it also allows to manually set the 
switching time.

# [Vim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim)

Adds modal editing, Vim shortcuts, command remapping, and some popular Vim 
plugins like EasyMotion, Surround, and such.
