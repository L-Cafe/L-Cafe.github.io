It's been a while since I joined https://www.hackthebox.eu/. Probably more than a year. And I haven't really had the time to spend trying to break into the machines, because of my university studies, but now summer is coming, so I will be able to dedicate more resources to it.

In case you don't know the website, it's a collection of vulnerable virtual machines that are designed to be hacked. It's kind of a CTF (Capture The Flag) competition. Actually, even joining the website is a CTF challenge (sorry, I'm not giving away hints).

In about 30 minutes, I managed my first user own,  with the [Poison](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/machines/profile/132) machine by [Charix](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/11060). To be completely honest, it was disappointingly easy. Disappointing in an unrealistic manner, as in: No real system administrator would set up his username account like that. So easy, in fact, I was able to obtain a shell in very little time.

In any case, I'm now stuck on the second step: Obtaining root privileges.

Most machines are set up like that: You need to gain user privileges, and then root privileges. You prove this by providing what's called a "flag". This flag is a secret string that you're able to read only after you have reached the required privilege level.

I intend to dedicate at least one hour daily to learning security tools and breaking into HackTheBox machines (preferably, much, much more, especially during the summer).

You can [follow me](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/1904), and message me. I love challenges!
