There have been many times I've been questioned when I state I have a MacBook and use macOS on a daily basis. With this article, I want to explain the reasons behind my choice, but in no way I expect or want everyone to switch to macOS. I am convinced it is the superior desktop OS, but I also think everyone should use what suits them. In my case, that would be macOS.

# It's familiar

Even though I've been using macOS for less than 6 months so far, I find it a very familiar and comfortable experience. Apart from the GUI, which may take a little bit to get used to (except with certain features such as the dock, which has been copied by Microsoft since Windows 7), the OS is Unix-like. It ships with bash, vim, and many POSIX utilities, this means I can apply my ample experience with Unix-like OSes, such as different Linux and BSD distributions.

The GUI deserves a few comments, though. For long-time macOS users, it makes a lot of sense, and Apple has been developing and evolving their interface gradually, and with gradual changes, so traditional macOS users already know how to use it, but for newcomers it's a bit different. I can say that, after the first month or two, I'm fully aware of the macOS GUI, its advantages and shortcomings, and can work as efficiently as I could on any of my previous Linux boxes.

The virtual desktops feature is very well done, by far much better implemented than it is on Windows 10, the integration the OS offers with the Touch Bar and Force Touch trackpad is great, and the OS is very carefully crafted and optimised for a specific set of machines, which is an advantage no other OS has.

# Lots of commercial software available

I love and use Linux regularly. I think it's a very solid operating system for the desktop, but the truth is... It just doesn't suit my needs sometimes. Sure, there are open-source alternatives to most commercial software, for example, GIMP is an Adobe Photoshop alternative, LMMS is a Fruity Loops/Logic Pro alternative, Inkscape is an Adobe Illustrator alternative, LibreOffice is a Microsoft Office alternative... But the reality is that these tools aren't up to speed and lack many features that make working with them unproductive. One example is the lack of non-destructive filters on GIMP, LMMS doesn't have nearly as many third party commercial plug-ins as the other two, LibreOffice has a TERRIBLE user interface (although this seems to be improving), and this lack of feature is generally true for most open-source software. Even if I like open-source, and really want to use it and discard closed-source software, it simply doesn't work for me. I'm less productive on open-source software than on their closed-source counterparts.

# Great trackpad

MacBooks have amazing trackpads. Considering trackpads are the primary input device on laptops, this is a huge deal. Before this MacBook, I used to carry a little mouse around because that trackpad was simply atrocious. Now I like the trackpad so much, I actually prefer it to the mouse. It's much more precise, and with its huge surface area combined with great palm rejection, I really have no need for a mouse.

# USB-C all the things!

People complain because this laptop has no "normal USB ports". What they are referring to is "USB type A ports", which are very badly designed (non-reversable), big, bulky, and obsolete. USB-C (actually, Thunderbolt 3), supports Ethernet networking, power delivery, video output, USB 3.1, digital and analog audio... What's not to like? I can charge my computer or output video from any of the 4 ports. Yes, please! USB-C is the future, and a USB-C to USB-A adaptor is a few euros. I want this laptop to last me a while. In 5 years, nobody will be using USB-A, and people will carry that port on their older laptops like some still carry VGA, HDMI and ethernet ports around. Yuck! No thanks! Thunderbolt 3 does all this and much more, including external GPUs.

# There's no Linux laptop alternative

I paid good money for this laptop, but I'm very willing to pay even more for a better Linux laptop. It simply does not exist. Sure, there are companies like System76 which build very powerful laptops, but, let's be honest, their design is ugly as hell. And, after a little investigation, I found that other laptops may outperform the Mac in a certain area, but not all. For example: One might be better at battery, but only because it has a Core i7 U CPU, which is very underperforming for my needs. Other computer might have a beefier GPU, but also be much more thicker, I carry this laptop everyday and I don't appreciate any extra weight, my back suffers. Other laptop could have a much higher resolution 4K touch screen, but also be made out of creaky plastic. Hell no!

So, I love POSIX and Unix, and this is as close as I can get while also owning good quality hardware. I don't wish to use Windows. Windows is an objectively inferior OS, and Microsoft's pathetic attempts at attracting Linux users by including a Bash shell and some other stuff are absolutely not enticing me to use Windows if I can help it.

# It's well designed

The model I own, the MacBook Pro 2016 15 inch with Touch Bar, has received very tough criticism for a few things, and I would like to comment on that:

## Battery life

This machine has received an insane amount of hate due to some people claiming ridiculous battery runtimes: As low as 4 hours of continuous use. Battery life was something Apple used to be proud of, MacBooks have always maintained a great balance of processing power, and thickness, so some people were worried and annoyed this MacBook performed worse than before.

This has not been my experience, however. This machine lasts me from 8 to 11 hours of usage, editing code, compiling, and even opening virtual machines, but it's true that when I use the GPU intensively, battery life decreases significantly faster than before, this is because the GPU is a very power-hungry AMD card, which, by the way, also produces a lot of heat, that must be quickly dissipated by the integrated fans. This is absolutely expected behaviour, as GPUs consume more power than CPUs when working hard, so, if you're editing video, you'll see worse battery life, obviously, but, think again. Â¿Do you **REALLY** need to edit video on the go? If I were to edit video, I'd be in a room, with a wall plug nearby, probably, so I don't think this is an issue.

## Butterfly 2 keyboard

When the Apple Butterfly keyboard mechanism was first launched (on the standard MacBook), many people disliked it due to the lack of feedback: Me included. It feels as if you were typing on a glass surface, and because there's basically no key travel, fingers hurt after a while in my experience, due to the fingers constantly hitting a hard surface. Butterfly 2 is much different, though. It has a very satisfying, but not obnoxiously loud clicking feel. The key travel has been improved, although not dramatically, but enough for me to love it. I'm starting to like it even more than my Cherry Red mechanical keyboard, and I've used this for more than 10 years now! I would definitely like to see this mechanism on more keyboards.

## Touch Bar

Many people quickly jumped to the conclusion that the Touch Bar was a useless gimmick without even trying. I guess this attitude is the typical attitude of the Apple products avoider kind of person (which I used to be, until not long ago, believe me!), but the matter of fact is that the Touch Bar is a great addition. Not only it allows you to perform certain quick commands easier (such as clicking "OK" or "cancel" on typical dialog boxes, accessing your bookmarked sites on Safari, switching tools on Affinity Photo, Pixelmator, Apple Pages, Microsoft Word, etc), but it also adds an extra layer of security. Because the Touch Bar has its own isolated CPU, it cannot be infected by normal means, and only talks to the OS through a dedicated bus (USB I believe), it means authentication dialogs cannot be forged, especially the ones that ask for your fingerprint, like on the App Store, which, by the way, is a very fast and convenient way of authenticating the user, and also allows for quick unlocking.

The lack of function keys is irrelevant, as the Touch Bar provides a far quicker and flexible way of operating the computer.

## It simply is pretty

The truth is that design is a very important part of productivity: a study found that when people worked in well designed offices, and used nicely designed hardware and appliances, were much more productive than on ugly environments and devices.
