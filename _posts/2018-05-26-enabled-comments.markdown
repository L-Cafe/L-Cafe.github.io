The blog now supports comments!

They're human-reviewed, so inappropriate comments will not be published.

And the best part is that they're fully static comments. No JavaScript required, no tracking plugins and no external comment systems!

[Staticman](https://staticman.net/) is truly awesome.

Give it a try if you want, but please don't comment spam or garbage.
