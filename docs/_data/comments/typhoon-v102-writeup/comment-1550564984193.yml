message: "This work reveals a kind of poetic mood and everyone would simply be attracted by it.\r\n\r\nAfter the Bourbon Restoration, as the trial participant \r\nof Louis XVI, David was missing out on his civil right and property, and \r\nwas made to leave his homeland to stay in Brussels where David also completed many works, \r\nlast but not least died in the strange land.  As modern humanity exposes their tanned skin during vacations that like to show off their pictures \r\nin social media websites."
