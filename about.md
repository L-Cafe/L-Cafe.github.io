I'm L-Cafe. I'm a Higher Technician Cross-Platform Application Developer, you
can find my notes (in Spanish) [here](https://github.com/L-Cafe/Apuntesdam2015).
Currently studying Computer Science & Engineering at
[URJC](http://www.urjc.es/), a Spanish university located in Madrid, you can
find my notes (in Spanish) [here](https://github.com/L-Cafe/II-URJC-2016).

I consider myself a passionate and creative individual, I’m always looking forward to learn more and better ways to do things, I love challenges.

My native country is Spain, so my primary language is Spanish. I can also speak
and write (British) English fluently, and I'm currently learning Chinese.
I generally only speak Spanish with Spaniards and hispanic people. All the code
I release is fully in English, including variable names, functions, and
comments, unless explicitly required to use Spanish.

I created this blog in order to have a centralised place to express my opinion
and share my knowledge with the world.

If you need to contact me, you can:

- Send me an email at <L-Cafe@linux.com>
- Tweet me at [@L__Cafe](https://twitter.com/L__Cafe)

Additionally, you can fetch my PGP public key, and/or follow me on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/lcafe).

## How I do my computing

I own a MacBook Pro 2016, 15 inch (with Touch Bar) and use macOS on a daily
basis. I also use Linux very often, and maintain some Linux servers, which run
Debian, Proxmox, CentOS, Fedora Server, and a Windows Server as an
experimentation platform.

On GitHub, I maintain some of my settings for a few applications of my choice.

For editing code, I enjoy using Vim. You can find my `.vimrc` settings
[here](https://github.com/L-Cafe/My-Preferences/tree/master/vim).

My shell of choice is zsh. My settings are published
[here](https://github.com/L-Cafe/My-Preferences/tree/master/macOS).

My favourite programming languages are: Rust, Ruby (on Rails), C and Swift.

For writing documents, I use a combination of LaTeX and Markdown, depending on
whether what I write will be published on the web (for which I use Markdown,
with LaTeX math formulas through MathJax), or needs to be printed, or released
as a PDF file, (for which I use plain LaTeX).

I enjoy producing audiovisual content. Specifically, I play the piano, and enjoy making chiptunes (8-bit music) with [Pico-8](http://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php). As well as photo editing, and I’m learning vector graphics.

For my photo editing and graphical design needs, I rely on
[Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/), and 
[Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/designer/).
